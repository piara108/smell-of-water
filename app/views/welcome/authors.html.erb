      Lang was eight when the Khmer Rouge took Cambodia, nine when taken from his family
      and put in a labor camp, and twelve when sent to the front to fight the Vietnamese.
      But he escaped from his infantry unit. And he survived.

      His wife was the last person to write about war. Her father fought with Patton in
      North Africa, and volunteered to be dropped behind enemy lines. But he never talked
      about it. He returned from the war to raise his children in the English tradition.
      And he made sure they learned to write.

      She heard Lang's story on their first date; it was the first thing he ever told her
      about himself. How he'd escaped from his unit and tried to find his family. But it was
      the ending that got her â€“ she had to write his story down.

      She had a degree in Indian Studies and so understood the underlying base of
      Khmer culture, and had visited Cambodia. She'd studied in Manila during the
      Vietnam War and had traveled to other Southeast Asian capitals, so knew how
      cosmopolitan they were at the time Lang was growing up outside of Phnom Penh.
      But she had to learn about war. Other veterans of the Vietnamese invasion
      were able to tell her more about what it was like to be an infantryman in
      Cambodia in 1979, and civilian survivors described the helplessness, and the
      confusion. They all described the destruction.

      Lang has a degree in Business Administration. He's an avid photographer, and took all the photographs for the book.

      He and Cornelia never go back to Cambodia empty handed. They have distributed thousands of pairs of reading glasses in silk-weaving
      villages, ensuring that weavers can continue to earn a living and pass on their skills until they choose to retire. During the record
      floods of 2011 and 2012 they distributed more than 100 pounds of medicine (with labels in Khmer).

      The couple makes their home on the San Francisco Bay. They kayak, hike and bike every chance they get.
