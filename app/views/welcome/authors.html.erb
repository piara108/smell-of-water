      Lang was eight when the Khmer Rouge took Cambodia, nine when taken from his family<br>
      and put in a labor camp, and twelve when sent to the front to fight the Vietnamese.<br>
      But he escaped from his infantry unit. And he survived.
    </p>

    <p>
      His wife was the last person to write about war. Her father fought with Patton in<br>
      North Africa, and volunteered to be dropped behind enemy lines. But he never talked<br>
      about it. He returned from the war to raise his children in the English tradition.<br>
      And he made sure they learned to write.
    </p>

    <p>
      She heard Lang's story on their first date; it was the first thing he ever told her<br>
      about himself. How he'd escaped from his unit and tried to find his family. But it was<br>
      the ending that got her â€“ she had to write his story down.
    </p>

    <p>
      She had a degree in Indian Studies and so understood the underlying base of<br>
      Khmer culture, and had visited Cambodia. She'd studied in Manila during the<br>
      Vietnam War and had traveled to other Southeast Asian capitals, so knew how<br>
      cosmopolitan they were at the time Lang was growing up outside of Phnom Penh.<br>
      But she had to learn about war. Other veterans of the Vietnamese invasion<br>
      were able to tell her more about what it was like to be an infantryman in<br>
      Cambodia in 1979, and civilian survivors described the helplessness, and the<br>
      confusion. They all described the destruction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lang has a degree in Business Administration. He's an avid photographer, and took all the photographs for the book.
    </p>

    <p>
      He and Cornelia never go back to Cambodia empty handed. They have distributed thousands of pairs of reading glasses in silk-weaving<br>
      villages, ensuring that weavers can continue to earn a living and pass on their skills until they choose to retire. During the record<br>
      floods of 2011 and 2012 they distributed more than 100 pounds of medicine (with labels in Khmer).
    </p>

    <p>
      The couple makes their home on the San Francisco Bay. They kayak, hike and bike every chance they get.
