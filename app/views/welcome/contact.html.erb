      If you would like to order Cambodian silk, e-mail Cornelia with what you
      would like her to bring back for you. She can get ikat (<span>hol</span>),
      brocade (<span>pamuong</span> and three kinds of <span>chorabab</span>),
      embroidered organza, and Buddhist ikat tapestries (<span>pidan</span>).
      Scarves, and wraps to go over evening clothes, are the most-requested items.
      Cornelia buys only from the finest weavers, and pays fair trade prices.
